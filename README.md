# BAPoolNet_Web

**Web Application For BAPoolNet.**

<p>I design a web application and an android application for my graduation project.</p>
<p>Based on a salient object detection method, Boundary-Awared PoolNet, I built a web platform where you can select a picture from your pc and detect the salient object.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the web application can be seen as a web server, you can use the android application to take a picture and then upload it. you will get the result of detection in the end.</p>
